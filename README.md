## Installing

To use this app, click on the title to be taken to the live app. Or you can clone the app and `npm install` the app to run it locally.

## How it works

This app uses OMDB's API to search for a movie by its title. You can then nominate that movie for the Shoppies or search for another movie. Once you have nominated 5 movies, you are notified of this and you can no longer nominate additional movies. You also cannot nominate the same movie twice.
